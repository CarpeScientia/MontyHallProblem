In a game show when picking a price hidden behind one of three doors, you have a chance of 1 in 3 of picking the price.
However when the game show host then eliminates one of the doors, switching your choice gives you a chance of 2 in 3 of picking the price, while sticking to your original choice still leaves the odds with 1 in 3.
Most people believe that the second pick, after the door elimination, has a 1 in 2 chance of winning, however most people are wrong.
